# 🌱 Crop Disease Detection and Assistance System

## 📌 Overview
This project provides a comprehensive solution for detecting plant diseases and offering farming assistance. It combines a **YOLO-based disease detection model** with an **LLM-powered chatbot (Aksara V1)** to guide farmers with actionable insights on disease management, fertilizers, and traditional remedies.

## 🌟 Features
- 🖼️ **Plant Disease Detection:** Uses a YOLO-based model to detect diseases in **cassava, sugarcane, mango, wheat, and rice**.
- 📊 **Disease Severity Estimation:** Estimates the severity of detected diseases to suggest appropriate treatments.
- 🤖 **Farming Assistant Chatbot (Aksara V1):** An **LLM-based assistant** trained on **South Indian farming practices**, providing:
  - 🌾 Fertilizer and pesticide recommendations.
  - 🌿 Traditional remedies for plant diseases.
  - ❓ Answers to common farming queries.

## 📚 Dataset
We use a dataset containing labeled images of plant diseases and their severity levels. The dataset is **preprocessed and augmented** for better model generalization.

- 🍃 **Mango Leaf Disease Dataset**
- 🌱 **Cassava Leaf Disease Classification**
- 🌾 **Rice Leaf Diseases Detection**
- 🎋 **Sugarcane Plant Diseases Dataset**
- 🥔 **Potato Disease Leaf Dataset**

## 🔧 Preprocessing & Dataset Preparation
### 🏗️ Data Processing
- 📂 **Merges** all individual datasets into a single dataset.
- 🏷️ Renames the label **"Healthy"** to unique class names to avoid conflicts.
- 🔀 Splits data into **training (80%), validation (10%), and testing (10%)**.
- 🔍 Resizes images to **448×448 pixels**.
- ⚙️ Normalizes images for **YOLOv8 training**.

## 🏋️‍♂️ Model Training
### 1️⃣ 🎯 **YOLO-based Plant Disease Detection**
- The **YOLO model** is trained on the dataset to classify plant diseases.
- Outputs **disease labels** and **severity levels**.

### 2️⃣ 🤖 **Aksara V1 Chatbot Integration**
- The chatbot is fine-tuned to answer **crop-related queries**.
- Uses the **detected disease label** to provide **treatment suggestions**.

## 📊 Disease Severity Estimation
- 🔬 Severity is estimated by calculating the **infected area ratio**.
- 🖤 Converts images to **grayscale** and applies **thresholding** to segment diseased regions.
- 📏 Computes **severity percentage** and categorizes into:
  - ✅ **Mild (<20%)**
  - ⚠️ **Moderate (20%-50%)**
  - 🚨 **Severe (>50%)**

## 🚀 Deployment
- 🌍 The **YOLO model** runs on a **web-based interface** for **real-time disease detection**.
- 🤝 The **Aksara V1 chatbot** is **integrated** into the platform to assist farmers with **disease management solutions**.

## 🛠️ How to Use
1. 📤 **Upload an Image:** Farmers can upload an image of their crop.
2. 🔍 **Get Disease Prediction:** The **YOLO model** predicts the **disease and severity**.
3. 💬 **Ask Aksara V1:** The chatbot provides **tailored advice** based on the detected disease.
4. 🌾 **Receive Treatment Suggestions:** The chatbot suggests **fertilizers, pesticides, and traditional remedies**.

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
- 📈 **Improve chatbot accuracy** using **reinforcement learning**.
- 📊 **Expand the dataset** to include more **regional crop diseases**.
- ⚡ **Optimize the YOLO model** for better **precision and recall**.

## 🙌 Acknowledgments
- 📂 **Dataset:** Publicly available **plant disease datasets**.
- 🛠️ **Model:** **YOLO** for detection, **Aksara V1** for assistance.
